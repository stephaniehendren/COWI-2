[Header] Beach Testing Results
Peterborough County-City Health Unit (PCCHU) tests local, public beaches during summer months to ensure that the water quality is safe for swimming.  The testing program begins in June and continues until the end of August each year.

[Sub Header] When is a Beach "Posted"?
A public beach is "posted" when the level of E. coli in the water is unsafe for recreational use, including swimming.  When a beach is posted, signs will be placed around the beach area to inform the public of the elevated bacteria in the water, and the potential threat to human health.  

[Sub Header] When is a Beach "Closed"?
A beach is "closed" when a significant risk to human health and safety has been identified (signs of hazardous or infectious material in the water, or when there is a blue-green algae bloom).  Swimming in the water is NOT permitted when a beach is closed and public access to the beach will be restricted or eliminated.  The beach is re-opened when the risk to human health and safety has been eliminated
