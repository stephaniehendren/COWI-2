[SECTION] Site Evaluation and Soil Assessment

[HEADER] Soils and Water table information
Schedule 3A: Site Evaluation Form Soil and water table information must be assessed to complete the design requirements for a sewage system permit. Soil type, groundwater and bedrock levels will determine the raised height of a sewage system, including contact area, and mantle requirements for the distribution system. 
Soil percolation time can be estimated using USCS, USDA texture classification or using percolation tests. 


8.2.1.2. Site Evaluation
(1)  A site evaluation shall be conducted on every site where a new or replacement sewage system is to be installed.

[HEADER] Percolation
(2)  The percolation time shall be determined by,
(a)	conducting percolation tests, or
(b)	classifying the soil according to one of the following methods,
(i)  	the Unified Soil Classification System as described in MMAH Supplementary 	Standard SB-6, “Percolation Time and Soil Descriptions”, or
(ii)  	the Soil Texture Classification as described in Chapter 3 of USDA, “Soil Survey 	Manual”.

(3)  Where the percolation time is determined by a percolation test, there shall be a minimum of 3 locations selected, suitably spaced to accurately evaluate the leaching bed area, with the highest percolation time of the tests being used.


[HEADER] Soil depth requirements
System design must meet the following soil depth requirements above groundwater table or impermeable soil either in native soil, leaching bed fill or a combination of native soil and leaching bed fill. 
System Class:
.	900mm
.	900mm
.	900mm
As follows:	
.	Absorption Trench 900mm
.	Fill Based Absorption trench 900mm
.	Filter Beds 900 mm
