This code section is amended to require maintenance of grease interceptors in accordance with the CAN/CSA-B481.4 standard.

[Sub header] 8.9.3.3. Interceptors
(1)	Every grease interceptor referred to in Article 8.1.3.1. shall be maintained in accordance with CAN/CSA-B481.4, “Maintenance of Grease Interceptors”.

[Sub header] CSA - B481.4 - Maintenance of Grease Interceptors
To help prevent grease buildup, grease interceptors are installed to separate and collect a maximum amount of FOG, (fats, oil, grease)

Grease interceptors are required to have markings indicating their FOG containment capacity. During operation, the grease interceptor’s containment chamber(s) fill with FOG. Once the containment capacity is reached, the interceptor’s removal efficiency begins to decrease until it no longer separates or captures FOG. 

To obtain the maximum removal efficiency from a grease interceptor, facilities need to
	(a) establish and adhere to a regular schedule of cleaning and maintenance
	(b) ensure that maintenance staff or external contractors follow the operating and maintenance (cleaning) instructions provided by the grease interceptor manufacturer

Frequency of maintenance depends not only on the amount of FOG generated but on the facility’s implementation of best management practices to reduce the FOG discharged into the sanitary sewer system.
