[SECTION] Introduction

[HEADER] Introduction
The Ontario Building Code (OBC) is a set of regulations which provides the standards required for the design, construction, renovation and installation of buildings in the province of Ontario. 
The OBC provides standards that are consistent in the manufacturing and supply of building materials which protect the public’s health, safety and welfare.

The Ministry of Municipal Affairs and Housing is responsible for the development and administration of the Ontario Building Code Act (BCA) and Ontario Building Code (OBC).  

Enforcement of the Ontario Building Code generally falls under the responsibility of local municipalities. Each municipality can enforce the provisions directly or in certain cases can contract out sections of the code to a Health Unit, Conservation Authority or a registered Code agency.  The section where this most commonly happens is Part 7, the plumbing code section and Part 8 the sewage system section of the Code. 
The principal authority, the organization that has been given responsibility under the code, is responsible for permits, inspections and enforcement of the code’s provisions.
